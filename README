PulseOS v0.1 

A friendly neighbourhood operating system with a 32 bit kernel. PulseOS is a hobby project heavily based 
upon the Bran's kernel development tutorial. Aims are to make PulseOS a fully functional Server operating
system. Further support to new and cutting edge research file-systems are planned to be implemented.

	To compile PulseOS you need to set up your own cross-compiler (preferably gcc for the i586-elf platform)
